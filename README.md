# This is my website

This repository is the sorce code for my website.

It's a pretty simple setup using the lovely [hugo](https://gohugo.io) server and
the [re-terminal theme](https://github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal).

## Helpful Commands

I am forgetful, so I am writing myself some notes to come back to later.

### Adding new content

If you want to create a new post, you can do so by...

```bash
hugo new content posts/${FILENAME}.${FILEEXT}
```

Most of the posts are written in Markdown. It's just better that way.

## CI/CD

The site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages, so look at their docs for more info.
