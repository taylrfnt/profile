This is my first content page for my site.

My name is Taylor, and I am a mechanical engineer turned software engineer with
an interest in in backend development, terminal emulation, and more recently,
how to host & serve static content over the web. You can read more about me
[here](../about).

This site will be a place to showcase my various projects and assorted things I
find interesting. I have no idea how often I will be posting, but expect an
assortment of topics and content.

I am not exactly sure how I should sign this post off, but expect more posts
coming in the future!
